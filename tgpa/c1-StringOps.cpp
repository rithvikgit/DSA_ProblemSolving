// String Ops
// Om has a string S of length N. But Om being perfectionist, doesn't likes the string. He decides to do perform M operations on the string to see if final string generated is perfect or not. For ith operation on string, Om selects a number Ai and reverses substring covered by Ai to N - Ai + 1 position. Om then proceeds to apply (i+1)th operation on string obtained after applying ith operation. It is guaranteed that 2 * Ai â‰¤ N. Strings consist of latin letters in lower case and are numbered from left to right starting from position 1.

// You need to report to Om the final string that he is going to obtain.

// Input The first line will contain the string S Second line contains integer M, which number of operations Om plans to apply to string Third line contains M space separated integers Ai which represents position in string where Om is going to transform string in ith operation.

// Output Output a single string, final string obtained after applying all operations one after one
