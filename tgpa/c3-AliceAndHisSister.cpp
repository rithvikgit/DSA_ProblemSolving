// Alice and his sister
// Alice and his sister are playing with two arrays a which consist n elements and b consisting of m elements. The array a is given to Alice and b to his sister. As Alice is really naughty he wants the minimum value of his array a should be at least as much as the maximum value of his sister's array b. Now You have to help Alice in achieving his condition. You can perform multiple operations on the array. In single operation, you are allowed to increase or decrease any element of any of the arrays by 1. Note that you are allowed to apply the operation on any index of the array multiple times. You need to find the minimum number of operations required to satisfy Alice's condition.
